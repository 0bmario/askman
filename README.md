# 📚 askman

**A simple, offline CLI tool for developers who want to use Unix/Linux terminal commands without googling/AI-ing every time or checking the [man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page).**

---

## 🤔 Why?

I didn't want to leave the terminal to search for the right command, and man pages aren't always "easy" to read.

---

## 🤖 What is askman?

`askman` lets you ask natural language questions about Unix/Linux commands and get helpful, example-driven answers.

---

## 💡 Example Usage

```bash
askman how to move all files to /docs  
```

**Output:**
```bash
mv
Move or rename files and directories. More information: <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/mv-invocation.html>.

Examples:
  Move a file or directory into an existing directory:
   mv {{path/to/source}} {{path/to/existing_directory}}

  Move multiple files into an existing directory, keeping the filenames unchanged:
   mv {{path/to/source1 path/to/source2 ...}} {{path/to/existing_directory}}
```

## 🏗️ MVP

- Uses dataset commands created from [tldr-pages common](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/tree/main/pages/common) folder 
- Provides semantic search for command examples

---

## 📦 Installation

Make sure you have [Rust and Cargo installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then run:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/cito-lito/askman
```

Download the `commands.db` file to the same directory as the executable (`~/.cargo/bin/commands.db`):
```bash
curl -L -o "$(dirname $(which askman))/commands.db" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cito-lito/askman/main/commands.db
```

This will install `askman` with a pre-built database.The first time you run `askman`, it will download the required model files.

---

## 🔧 Building Your Own Database

If you want to customize the command database:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Place your tldr-pages into the `common/` directory:
   Make sure the files follow the format of the [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#markdown-format).

3. Build and run the import tool:

```bash
cargo run --bin import_tldr
```

This will create a new `commands.db` file with your custom command set.

## Uninstall

remove the db file first
```bash
rm ~/.cargo/bin/commands.db // or the directory where the executable is
```

remove the executable
```bash
cargo uninstall askman
```
